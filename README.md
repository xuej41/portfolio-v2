# Portfolio V2

Second iteration of my personal portfolio website, created using Vite + React.

I was inspired to create this project as my first portfolio website [portfolio-v1](https://github.com/xuej41/portfolio), created using vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript, did not include a router which I wanted as it would allow me to add more projects with greater detail.

This website is made using [React](https://react.dev/) boostrapped with [Vite](https://vite.dev/) for the frontend, and uses [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/) for routing.
